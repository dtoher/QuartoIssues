I just want to be able to have a 

Published: date (just the date, no time)
Modified: date and time

The format(Sys.time(), format='%B %d %Y at %H:%M') does exactly what I want it to do in R, but not when I try to use it in the yaml. 
If I try to use date-modified: now as suggested <https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates> then the time doesn't appear unless you set the date-format option, but that then changes the appearance of the published date.
